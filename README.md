# openmirror

`openmirror` is a mirror data structure which support paring function.

Actually this idea inspired by Sony SRS XB12 speaker, I got two and paring them for listen music stereoly. When they paring, you turn up the voice on the one, and the other one's voice will changed at the same time, that's funny.

This project under the alpha stage, we will improve it continously, wait and see.
